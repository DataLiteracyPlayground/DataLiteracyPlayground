## Data Literacy Playground

Hi, and welcomed me to the Data Literacy Playground!

This project was originally proposed by Tanya Dorey-Elias at the LAK 2017 Hackathon
and was kickstarted by inclusion in the Mozilla Open Leader Program cohort 4.

The playground has three zones:

- Data and Me
- Data and The Academy
- Data and Society
