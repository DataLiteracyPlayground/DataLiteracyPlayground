## Data Literacy Playground

Hi, and welcome to the Data Literacy Playground!

This project was originally proposed by Tanya Dorey-Elias at the LAK 2017 Hackathon
and was kickstarted by inclusion in the Mozilla Open Leader Program cohort 4.

The playground has three zones:

- [Data and Me](/me/)
- [Data and The Academy](/academy/)
- [Data and Society](/society/)
