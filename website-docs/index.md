This project was originally proposed by Tanya Dorey-Elias at the LAK 2017 Hackathon
and was kickstarted by inclusion in the Mozilla Open Leader Program cohort 4.

The playground has three zones:

  <div class="col-xs-12 col-md mt-3">
    <a href="/me" class="home-card home-card--me">
      <div class="home-card--contents">
